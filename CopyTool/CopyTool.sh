#!/bin/bash
# The start of the new and improved Mac Copy Tool
# Created as a test for more complex functions, source scripts and other stuff
# Connor Sanders May 2018.

# GOALS
# - Single file only. No dependencies aside from the obvious (intel mac etc).
# - If other files or things are required, ability to download install, without needing to rerun.
# - Clear and easy commands
# - Clear and easy method for selecting source and destination locations

# NOTES
# - Yes, this can be made really easy using Automator.
# - This will probably become a command line tool for mac.
 
# To Do:
# - Functions/ inital check for intel mac etc -- System Requirements
# - Notate the steps required and assign dependencies
# - Easy to read ReadME
